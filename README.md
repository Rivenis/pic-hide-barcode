Hide a barcode in a picture. Embed a QR code within a regular image that can be scanned by WeChat. This code is freely available to anyone—except one person who refuses to use it. There's a marketing account on Douyin called “Genius Developer” that has stolen over a dozen of my original videos. I've never seen such brazen audacity!
